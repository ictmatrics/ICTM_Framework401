                The <strong>ICTM Framework</strong> proves that <em>small footprints can still deliver powerful
                    features.</em>
                Built with PHP, MySQL, jQuery, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, it strikes the perfect balance between
                simplicity and functionality. Whether you’re a beginner looking for an easy-to-learn framework or a
                professional developer who values flexibility and code control, ICTM provides a solid foundation for
                modern web development.

                For anyone seeking a lightweight, developer-friendly, and efficient PHP MVC framework, ICTM is an
                excellent choice.
                <p><strong>ICTM Framework 4.0</strong> is a lightweight yet robust <strong>PHP MVC framework</strong> optimized for <strong>PHP 8.3</strong> and above, ensuring compatibility with the latest language features and performance improvements. By leveraging the advancements in PHP 8.3, such as enhanced Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, improved type safety, and optimized memory handling, ICTM 4.0 delivers a more efficient runtime environment. The framework’s minimal footprint reduces overhead, allowing developers to build scalable applications with faster execution speeds while maintaining clean separation of concerns through its MVC architecture.</p>
                <p>Compared to its earlier versions, ICTM Framework 4.0 significantly improves <strong>execution speed, database query handling, and resource utilization.</strong> With native support for modern PHP features, developers gain increased flexibility, stronger error handling, and simplified debugging during the development phase. This release emphasizes performance-driven design while preserving the framework’s core principle of simplicity—providing a balance between lightweight coding structures and powerful development capabilities suitable for small to mid-scale applications.</p>
